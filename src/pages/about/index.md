## What do we want to do?

KB Editing exists to help writers tell their stories effectively and realistically.

## Where do we want to go?

KB Editing strives to be a writer's partner to guide them on towards their goals.

## How did we get here?

KB Editing spawned from an emerging writer wishing for the services she needed to succeed without spending her savings â€” or lack thereof. With a writing degree and many years' experience under her belt, Kelsey decided to be the service she was looking for. She began a word-of-mouth campaign to let her writer friends know she was there for them. And after her first novel-editing client, Kelsey began KB Editing.
