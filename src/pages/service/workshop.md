## Want a personal or group discussion?

Sometimes the most effective way to make progress in your revision process is to hear how your peer(s) react and interpret your project and what questions they are left with. Workshop is the safest and most productive space for doing just that.

Workshop sessions discuss reader perceptions and how they line up with the writer's goal; share methods for improving moments in the project; provide tips for any organizational, mechanical, formatting, or stylistic improvements; and help with any other questions or concerns you may have.

## Pricing*

When it comes to refining your work, it can be frustrating to find help without a restricting cost. Because of this, my prices are negotiable. I don’t want money to keep you from sharing your story. Reach out to me, and we’ll work out a plan.

**Workshop prices vary** and depend on length of the workshop session, type of manuscript, elements of workshop focused on, number of people involved, and miscellaneous factors. **Shoot me a message, and we'll work out the fairest price for everyone.**
