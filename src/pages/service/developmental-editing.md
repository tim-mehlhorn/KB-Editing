title: DEVELOPMENTAL EDITING
---
## Need some un-biased guidance?

The most important step in the revision process — and a personal favorite at KB Editing — is development. This part can be tricky when doing it alone because we, as the writer, tend to get attached to what we've created. That's where an outsider's perspective is beneficial. They're a un-biased reader who wants to help you create the strongest piece possible. 

**What does this involve?** 

Developmental editing takes an objective view of your entire project to see what moments or sections may not be adding to the larger message. Then, it works through those moments to see how they can be developed into a more effective addition — or if they simply should be removed. Developmental editing also takes a look at plot, structure, character development, voice, and overall craft to offer any suggestions to guide you towards your best work. 

**Please note, developmental editing does not include proofreading. For more details on that service offering, please click here.**
