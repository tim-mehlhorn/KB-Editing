heading: GET YOUR STORY OUT THERE
description: >-
  Do you have a story you’ve been wanting to tell but not sure how to polish it
  up? I’m here for you. With over five years of editing experience, I’m ready to
  help you. My list of services and pricing* are below.


  I am passionate about getting your words out in the world, and I know costs
  can be restricting. My prices are negotiable, because I don’t want money to
  keep you from realizing a dream. Reach out to me, and we’ll work out a plan.
