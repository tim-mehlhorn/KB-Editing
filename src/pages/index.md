heading: GET YOUR STORY OUT THERE
description: >-
  Do you have a story you’ve been wanting to tell but not sure how to polish it
  up? 




  I’m here for you. With over five years of editing experience, I’m ready to
  help you. I am passionate about getting your words out in the world, and I
  know costs can be restricting. My prices are negotiable, because I don’t want
  money to keep you from realizing a dream. Reach out to me, and we’ll work out
  a plan.
